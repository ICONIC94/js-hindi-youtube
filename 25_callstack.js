// Global executiion 
// memory phase ( here all the variables and the methods are initialiseda and allocated a memory )
// execution phase (here all value are given the values. if there is a function then a (new variable environment + thread is created ) and memory and execution phase are run again).


// All the function are loaded into a stack and follow the LIFO technique.
